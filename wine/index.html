			<h1>WINE</h1>

			<p> WINE (Warning mINEr) is a mining tool that can identify complex and unique code examples
				from the reports generated by a static bug finder automatically for tool designers 
				to find wrong and RW-prone rules.
			</p>
			<p> RW (Rejected Warning) is rejected to be fix after being checked by users althogh 
				warnings are correct in terms of the rule's original intention.
			</p>
			<p> WW (Wrong Warning) is caused by incorrect implementation of the rules, i.e., bugs
				in the rule implementation caused by desingers.
			</p>
			<p> TW (True Warning) is useful warning that can be helpful to the users to find and 
				correct the bugs in the program.
			</p>
			<p> There are two assumptions. <br>
				1) Unique and low frequent patterns of code in adetection report are unusual,
				which may be a bug (TW), and also, common and high frequent patterns of code in a
				detection report are normal because they may be ignored cases, which may not
				be a bug (RW). <br>
				2) Complex patterns of examined code need more complex rule design and are
				easy to be a missed case of design. The cmoplex code examples may indicate
				WW generated by bugs in the implementation of rules.
			</p>

			<h2>Reported PMD issues</h2>
			* One issue contains at least one case. It means that there are at least one
			different case to occur problem in implementation or design in the bug finder.
			There would be one or more cases in one issue.
			<h3>1. Broken Null Check</h3>
			<h4>- Issue Number: 3071<h4>
			<h4>- Issue Link: <a href="https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3071">https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3071</a><h4>
			<h4>- Description<h4>
				<p>=> The issue is related to WW. WINE found that there are some missed or incorrect implementation
					of the rule.
				</p>

				<h4>- Issue Link: <a href="https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3080">https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3080</a><h4>
				<h4>- Description<h4>
					<p>=> The issue is related to WW and Designing a New Rule. 
						WINE found that there are some missed or incorrect implementation of the rule.
						In addition, it found needs to design a new rule for PMD.
