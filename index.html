    <h2>Intelligent Software Engineering Lab</h2>
    <h3>@School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering,
        Handong Global University, Korea</h3>
    <h2>/Intro/</h2>
    <p> We, ISELers, study challenging problems in Softatware Engineeirng,
        particulary problems related to debugging activities.
        We believe what we are going to do explicitly helps software developers and implicitly
        inherently helps people all over the world who use various software products.
    </p> 
    <p>Our major apporaches to solve the problems are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
        Mininig Software Repositories (MSR).
    </p>
